# files_snapshots

Access filesystem snapshots from Nextcloud.

![settings](screenshots/settings.png)

Allows using filesystem snapshots (such as provided by zfs and btrfs) instead of builtin Nextcloud snapshots.

## Limitations

This app does not automatically create snapshots itself, because of this it might not have a snapshot
for every change made to the file.

Since no snapshots are created by the app, when reverting a file, any change made to a file since the last snapshot will be lost.

## Configuring

In order to access snapshots, two things need to be configured under the admin settings.

- snapshot format: where the snapshots of the Nextcloud data directory can be found
 
  example: `/srv/http/.zfs/snapshot/%snapshot%/nextcloud/data/`  
  where `/srv/http/nextcloud/data` is the Nextcloud data directory  
  and `/srv/http` is a folder which is being snapshoted to `/srv/http/.zfs/snapshot`.
   
- snapshot folder date format: How the snapshot date is formatted in the snapshot name
  
  example: `Y-m-d_H:i:s` will correctly match snapshots named `autosnap_2017-05-27_00:00:01_hourly`
